			<h3>Drupal Theme</h3>
			<p>While working at Weill Cornell, I built a responsive theme for our base Drupal distribution. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and was built using Sass to modualrize the styles. I wrote with the design team in mind- they will be building various sites based off this theme, and they have a theme file that includes the relevant styles that they can override easily, along with a set of color variables to make their jobs easier. One of the most interesting parts of this was the navigation, and making it functional across screen sizes.</p>
			<div>The theme has been applied to <a target="_blank" href="http://cornellradiationoncology.org">Radation Oncology</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://weillcornellpainmedicine.com">Pain Medicine</a>, and <a href="http://weillcornellanesthesiology.org" target="_blank">Anesthesiology</div>

			<h3>Telecommute Project</h3>
			<p><em>Please note this project was a proof of concept, focused on functionality over looks.</em></p>
			<p>This is a project that I built in AngularJS for a 10% time project/competition at my previous emplloyer. Take a look at the code and requirements <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/alanmoo/team-mayo-telecommute">on bitbucket</a>. A demo of the project is hosted <a target="_blank" href="telecommute/app">here</a>. Note that it's somewhat responsive.</p>

			<h3>Mobile retrofitting</h3>
			<p>During another 10% time project I added media queries to our physician profiles so that users on mobile devices that support media queries can more easily view the profiles.</p>
			<p><a target="_blank" href="http://weillcornell.org/physician/clcole/index.html">Example profile</a></p>

		<div class="project">
			<h3>Wordpress</h3>
			<p>Oh hey, I can figure out Wordpress. And how to integrate a few plugins and <em>slightly</em> change the theme. <a target="_blank" href="http://edificenyc.com">Nothing impressive, but here you go.</a></p>
