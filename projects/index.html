			<h3>Drupal Theme</h3>
			<p>This is a responsive theme for my company's base Drupal Distrobution. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and was built using Sass to modualrize the styles. I wrote with the design team in mind- they will be building various sites based off this theme, and they have a theme file that includes the relevant styles that they can override easily, along with a set of color variables to make their jobs easier.</p>

			<h3>Telecommute Project</h3>
			<p><em>Please note this project is under active development. It's in a pre-alpha stage right now with no backend functionality. Forgive its ugliness.</em></p>
			<p>This is a project that I'm building in AngularJS for a 10% time project/competition at my company. Take a look at the code and requirements <a href="https://bitbucket.org/amooiman/team-mayo-telecommute">on bitbucket</a>. A demo of the project is hosted <a href="telecommute">here</a></p>

			<h3>Mobile retrofitting</h3>
			<p>During another 10% time project I added media queries to our physician profiles so that users on mobile devices that support media queries can more easily view the profiles.</p>

			<h3>Wordpress</h3>
			<p>Oh hey, I can figure out Wordpress. And how to integrate a few plugins and <em>slightly</em> change the theme. <a href="http://edificenyc.com">Nothing impressive, but here you go.</a></p>
