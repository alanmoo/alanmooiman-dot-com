This has probably been the most exciting year of my life. In 2015, I

* spoke at an incredibly popular meetup ([BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com/))
* gave my first [conference talk](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/speakers/alan-mooiman)
* went to Burning Man for a second time
* started an amazing new position at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/)
* built amazing new relationships and strengthened my existing ones
* spent 2 months living on my own for the first time in my life (I didn't starve!)
* spent the same 2 months living in Manhattan -  something I've always wanted to do
* got over the "I don't like working out" hump and even started taking aerial yoga classes regularly (I need to get back on this once I live somewhere permanently)
* started a cross-country road trip (I'm on it now)
* had countless other adventures with various friends

Through all of this, I've spent the majority of the year without a permanent home. I got curious and decided to see how many places I've spent the night this year. So I checked my Swarm checkin history and personal calendar to get the final count: 59.

* The Brooklyn loft I lived in until the end of April
* An East Village Studio I subletted for two not-quite-continuous months
* 15 other places across 4 boroughs of NYC (11 beds - mostly AirBnB's, 4 couches)
* The farm in Manchester Center, VT where I now technically reside
* The inn owned by the farm family in Manchester Center
* Portland, Maine (3 locations)
* Portland, OR (3 places)
* New Paltz, NY (2 places)
* Seattle, WA (2 places)
* Bellingham, WA (2 rooms in the same resort)
* Toronto (2 places)
* Bar Harbor, Maine (2 places)
* London, England (2 places)
* Kalamth Falls (2 rooms in one motel- on the way to and from Burning Man)
* Black Rock City, NV
* Egg Harbor Township, NJ
* Detroit, OR
* Exton, PA
* Jacksonville, FL
* Lake Park, FL
* Elysburg, PA
* Burlington, VT
* Hillsboro, NJ
* Hoboken, NJ
* Orlando, FL
* Washington, D.C.
* Asheville, NC
* A Super 8 somewhere in Alabama
* Dallas, TX
* Childress, Texas
* Santa Fe, NM
* 3 red-eye flights

The last time I've spent 2 consecutive weeks going to bed in the same place was the first half of August!

I'm going to have a permanent home in 2016, but I'm still aiming to travel a bit. My outlook on life is that I don't want to regret saying no to an opportunity, so I look at everything through that lens. Even if something turns out to be a less-than-stellar experience, I'd rather do it and know than regret not doing it at all. It seems to be a strategy that's working out pretty well, so I'm going to keep it up next year.
