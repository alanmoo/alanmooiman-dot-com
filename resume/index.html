			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<div class="resume_item">
				<h3 class="job_title">Engineering Lead</h3>
				<div class="organization"><a href="https://squarefoot.com">SquareFoot</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">February 2020 - Present</div>
				<p>
					SquareFoot is a commercial real estate brokerage, focused on client acquisition via our web platform. I lead the team of 4 engineers resposible for the front-end of this platform, which is used for showing listings to potential clients, onboarding them into our sales flow, and then facilitating the broker/client search experience. It's a React application run on a Node.js server which connects to a GraphQL API. I work closely with the product manager, backend/infrastructure manager, head of engineering, and the design team to deliver new features to the platform while reducing technical debt that accumulated as the platform was first being shaped.
				</p>
				<p>Some significant accomplishments include:
					<ul>
						<li>I led work on the quarterly key result of improving mobile Lighthouse scores for key SEO pages from in the 20's to 70's (with more to come pending larger projects)</li>
						<li>I led the upgrade on the web application, which had core dependencies many years out of date (e.g. Node.js v6 when v13 was the most recent)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3 class="job_title">Engineering Manager</h3>
				<div class="organization"><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">May 2017 - January 2020</div>
				<p>
					I led a team of 6 web and devops engineers across North America and Germany. We built projects to support Mozilla's mission of improving internet health. For this, I worked closely with the design manager, product manager, and digital director to improve the Foundation's main site at foundation.mozilla.org. The design and engineering teams also functioned as a service organization internally, helping address the digital needs of other teams within the organization. I partnered with the leaders of those teams to identify the best way for us to address their needs while pushing forward on our team's internal road map. This happened by asking not just "what are you trying to do?" but "what problem are you trying to solve?", a subtle but important distinction. I also worked with my team to identify workflow challenges, improve their skills, and foster best software development practices while keeping us moving forward. Finally, as both the engineering lead and most senior technical manager in the org, I ensured organizational technology decisions were made prudently with an eye on long term impact and cost.

				<div class="organization_dates">September 2015 - May 2017</div>
				<p>
					Upon joining the team, I started working on the existing Webmaker Android app, a web-based app in a native wrapper that existed to empower users to create content on the web, instead of just consuming it. I also helped to create a UI framework for use across our web properties, and built out/enhanced a number of other sites like science.mozilla.org, foundation.mozilla.org, and the initial back-end work for mozillapulse.org as I learned Django.
