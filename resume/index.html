			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<div class="resume_item">
				<h3 class="job_title">Engineering Manager</h3>
				<div class="organization"><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">May 2017 - Present</div>
				<p>
					I lead a team of 6 (+ 1 indirect report) web and devops engineers across North America and Germany. We build projects to support Mozilla's mission of improving internet health through shaping the global conversation, connecting leaders, and rallying citizens. For this, I work closely with the design manager and digital director to improve the Foundation's main site at foundation.mozilla.org. The design and engineering teams also function as a service organization internally, helping address the digital needs of other teams within the organization. I work closely with the leaders of those teams to identify the best way for us to address their needs while pushing forward on our team's internal roadmap. This happens by asking not just "what are you trying to do?" but "what problem are you trying to solve?", a subtle but important distinction. I also work with my team to identify the most challenging process points and figure out how to reduce friction for them, while keeping us moving forward.

				<h3 class="job_title">Front End Developer</h3>
				<div class="organization"><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">September 2015 - May 2017</div>
				<p>
					Upon joining the team, I started working on the existing Webmaker Android app, a web-based app in a native wrapper that existed to empower users to create content on the web, instead of just consuming it. I also helped to create a UI framework for use across our web properties, and built out/enhanced a number of other sites like science.mozilla.org, foundation.mozilla.org, and the initial back-end work for mozillapulse.org as I learned Django.
